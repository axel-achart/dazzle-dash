## Data Storytelling

Data storytelling is the art of conveying a narrative to an audience using a collection of relevant data and compelling visualizations.  
Its goal is to make data analysis insights accessible and actionable for a specific audience—bridging the gap between numbers and real-world impact.  
Effective data storytelling attracts attention with context, engages the audience, and highlights meaningful data to support decision-making.
